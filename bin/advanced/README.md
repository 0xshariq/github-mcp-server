## üîÑ Workflow Automation

### `gflow` - Complete Git Flow
**Purpose:** Execute the full git workflow in one command  
**Basic Equivalent:** `gadd` + `gcommit` + `gpush`

```bash
gflow "implement user authentication"   # Stage all ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push
gflow "fix: resolve login bug"          # Conventional commit style
gflow "docs: update API documentation"  # Documentation updates
```

**Use cases:**
- Quick commits when all changes are ready
- Small feature implementations
- Bug fixes that don't require staging review

**Safety features:**
- Validates repository state before execution
- Confirms all changes will be committed
- Provides rollback information if push fails

### `gquick` - Quick Commit Workflow
**Purpose:** Fast local commits without pushing  
**Basic Equivalent:** `gadd` + `gcommit`

```bash
gquick "fix typo in header"             # Quick local commit
gquick "WIP: experimenting with layout" # Work-in-progress commits
gquick "save progress before lunch"     # Save points during development
```

**When to use:**
- Experimental changes you're not ready to push
- Frequent save points during development
- Local commits before review/testing

### `gsync` - Synchronization Workflow
**Purpose:** Stay synchronized with remote repository  
**Basic Equivalent:** `gpull` + `gpush`

```bash
gsync                                   # Pull latest, push local commits
gsync --force                           # Force push after rebase
gsync --dry-run                         # Show what would be synchronized
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures you're working with latest code
- Shares your commits with team
- Handles common merge scenarios automatically
