gfresh --safe                         # Safe repository refresh
gbackup --restore                     # Restore from backup if needed
```

### üßπ Repository Maintenance
```bash
gclean --stats                        # Check repository health

## üìà Progression from Basic

These advanced tools build upon the [basic operations](../basic/README.md) to create sophisticated workflows:

1. **Master basic operations first** - Understand `gadd`, `gcommit`, `gpush`, etc.
2. **Learn workflow combinations** - Start with `gflow`, `gquick`, `gsync`
3. **Explore development tools** - Use `gdev`, `gsave`, `gfix` for daily work
4. **Add safety practices** - Implement `gbackup`, `gclean` for maintenance
5. **Master professional workflows** - Use `gworkflow`, `grelease` for production

Perfect for experienced developers who want to streamline complex Git workflows and implement professional development practices.
